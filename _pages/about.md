# üí° About Me
<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am currently in my senior year at Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University in China
I am currently engaged in multimodal sentiment analysis, medical multimodal data fusion and other research. If you're looking for an intern, please feel free to email me at <a href='mailto:yueshenghuang@stu.gpnu.edu.cn'>yueshenghuang@stu.gpnu.edu.cn</a> I am looking for an internship.
I am enrolled in the Department of Internet of Things Engineering in GPNU's School of Computer Science under the supervision of Assistant Professor Jiawen Li. Many of the topics I explored and experimented with myself.
In 2024, I won the Guangdong Provincial Person of the Year (10 winners from Guangdong) and the Student representative of the People's Daily National Scholarship (only 4 winners from Guangdong).
My research interests include medical artificial intelligence, social computing, etc. As I have not yet deeply studied, my published papers are at a low level. I am honored to be one of the reviewers of the IJCNN International Conference.

  <div id="thesis-en" class="thesis-abstract">
    <strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br>
    With the in-depth development of artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies, the application potential of multimodal sentiment analysis in the educational field is increasingly evident. Traditional unimodal emotion recognition methods have limitations in capturing students' complex emotional states, while multimodal analysis significantly improves the accuracy of emotion recognition by integrating facial expressions, speech information, and physiological signals. Under the current background of educational informatization, there is an urgent demand for student mental health monitoring. However, existing methods face challenges such as poor timeliness, strong subjectivity, and difficulties in scaling, which limit their widespread adoption in campus environments.<br><br>
    
    To address these challenges, this paper proposes and implements a student emotion intelligent analysis and monitoring system based on ESP32 and ESP32S3 hardware platforms, combined with lightweight multimodal fusion algorithms and large language models. The system aims to utilize low-cost, highly integrated embedded technology to fuse multi-source data including facial, speech, and heart rate information, providing educators, parents, and students with real-time, accurate, and convenient emotion monitoring and support tools.<br><br>
    
    At the hardware level, a distributed dual-mainboard architecture using ESP32 and ESP32S3 is adopted. The ESP32 mainboard integrates ESP32CAM and heart rate sensors to implement facial expression recognition, physiological data collection, and basic feedback. The ESP32S3 mainboard integrates a digital microphone, audio amplifier, display screen, etc., to achieve intelligent dialogue functions based on Baidu's ERNIE Bot API. At the software level, a Node.js-based server is constructed, SQLite is used for data storage, and multi-role web application interfaces for teachers, students, and parents are developed. On the algorithmic level, the system implements facial emotion recognition based on Deepface, speech emotion analysis using the ERNIE Bot API, designs a dynamic weight decision-level multimodal fusion algorithm, and introduces a data-volume-based multi-model emotion trend prediction method. Additionally, prompt optimization is employed to enhance the performance of large language models in emotional support dialogue tasks.<br><br>
    
    Finally, the system hardware platform was successfully built and debugged, with comprehensive functional testing and verification conducted on the software system, including white-box testing and black-box testing. The test results demonstrate stable operation of all system modules, compliance with design requirements, and effective integration of multimodal data for student emotion state analysis and monitoring, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the design.<br><br>
